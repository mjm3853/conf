The LPC brings together the top developers working on the “plumbing” of Linux — kernel subsystems, core libraries, windowing systems, etc. — and gives them three days to work together on core design problems. The conference is divided into several working sessions focusing on different “plumbing” topics, as well as a general paper track.\n\nA good topic will cut across community boundaries, and should generate vigorous discussion leading to beneficial change. One excellent example from a past LPC was “From Naught to Sixty in 5 Seconds” back in 2008. This topic involved a sizable fraction of the Linux-related software stack, and required coordinated changes to many components. It set the goal of booting a netbook in five seconds, and within a few months actually achieved a three-second boot. That said, talks describing lessons learned during an already-completed implementation effort are also welcome, as long as they are likely to generate good discussion and to help others avoid similar pitfalls in future implementation efforts.",
