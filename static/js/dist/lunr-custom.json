The LPC brings together the top developers working on the “plumbing” of Linux — kernel subsystems, core libraries, windowing systems, etc. — and gives them three days to work together on core design problems. The conference is divided into several working sessions focusing on different “plumbing” topics, as well as a general paper track.\n\nA good topic will cut across community boundaries, and should generate vigorous discussion leading to beneficial change. One excellent example from a past LPC was “From Naught to Sixty in 5 Seconds” back in 2008. This topic involved a sizable fraction of the Linux-related software stack, and required coordinated changes to many components. It set the goal of booting a netbook in five seconds, and within a few months actually achieved a three-second boot. That said, talks describing lessons learned during an already-completed implementation effort are also welcome, as long as they are likely to generate good discussion and to help others avoid similar pitfalls in future implementation efforts.",

You can expect this year to be the most monumental and epic DerbyCon we have ever put out.\n\nThe idea of DerbyCon started in a pizza shop in Louisville after a few of us thought how awesome it would be to create a conference in Louisville Kentucky. The 4th street live area was awesome and we had been to so many conferences that we felt we could make one where everyone was welcome. DerbyCon has and continues to be a conference put together and run by awesome people in the security industry and by its attendees. We believe that DerbyCon is a central location for everyone to come share their research – hang with friends – and meet new ones. We hope to see you this year!",

A secure public ledger concept can be applied to almost all aspects of doing business whilst removing slow and outdated workflows.\n\nUsing a peer-to-peer network and a distributed timestamping server, a blockchain database can be managed autonomously.
