## Conference Details:

Started in 2010, London HalfStack has events at least once a month to discuss all things interesting in the desktop and mobile web world. The format includes meetups, panels, and conferences, and always a pub after each event.

For seven years, we've had regular JavaScript meetup events. And then we spend time discussing JavaScript at a pub and/or CodeNode. For the third time, we're flipping this around and bringing the talks to a pub in the Shoreditch area.

Talks will include a variety of modern front-end development topics (ES6, TypeScript, React, Dojo 2, WebGL, and much more) from leading speakers based primarily in London. The Call for Papers closed on the 14th of July. We will let all potential speakers know our answer by mid-August.

All tickets include lunch, coffee, tea, drinks, great talks, conference t-shirt, swag, afterparty and more!
