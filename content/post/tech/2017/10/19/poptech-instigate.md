About PopTech

We’re a global community of innovators, working together to expand the edge of change.

We live in an era in which humanity’s capabilities—and our challenges—are progressing faster than most of us can comprehend. As we confront the major issues of our century, we’ve never had better tools at our disposal, or a more pressing need to use them wisely.

Yet most efforts to create positive change remain locked in ‘silos of excellence’: public health experts talk (mostly) to other public health experts; designers talk to other designers; technologists talk to other technologists, and so on. This approach slows the spread of innovation from field to field, limits our awareness of what tools are even available, and throttles the pace of change.
