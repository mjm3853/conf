## Conference Details: 

The Twitch Community is filled with unique stories.

From the most established streamers, to those brand new to the scene, to the viewers, chatters, & emote spammers, we’ve all had a hand in creating something special. TwitchCon is a celebration of those stories and a showcase for the creators who will write the next chapters.

Join us for a glorious weekend-long journey through the personalities, games, and groups that make Twitch, Twitch. Whether you’re new to Twitch and want to improve your channel, trying to make the leap to Partnership, meet other streamers you admire, check out the latest games and hardware, or just watch some unique content with the rest of the community, TwitchCon has something for everyone.
