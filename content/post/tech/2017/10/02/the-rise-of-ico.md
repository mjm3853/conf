## Conference Details:

Due to advances in technological capabilities provided by blockchain, crowdfunding is easier than ever before. Initial Coin Offerings (ICO), Token Generation Events (TGE) and Initial Token Offerings (ITO) represent a new fundraising mechanism and have just become the dominant way to fund new projects based on the innovative technology.

Some praise the new fundraising mechanism and the emerging token-based economy for their liquidity and their low hanging fruits. Others identify them as scam filled with opportunistic money and warn that the bubble is ready to burst.

HATE IT OR LOVE IT? DEAL WITH IT! BECAUSE IT’S HERE TO STAY.
