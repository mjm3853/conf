## Conference Details:

Every year the Empire team ramps up, we try to highlight one of the things that makes New York City an amazing place to live, work, visit, and git push origin master in.

This year we return to showcase the little language you know and love at the Academy of Medicine on museum mile, this October 12 and 13.

We're so excited that we're able to feature New York at its finest, and we're really looking forward to pushing Empire, JS, and Node.js towards another incredible year.

Our search for talks and workshops is open! Please consider sharing your work and story at our event, and/or encourage an inspiring person you know to do the same!
