## Conference Details: 

This is our seventh year running and each year we learn and get better. We’re super excited about this year and know it’s going to be amazing. DerbyCon is a place where everyone is welcome. You learn. You share, and you have a blast doing it. It’s all about family and friends. This year we have a lot of exciting things planned and we hope you like it.

This years theme is “Legacy”. This is our last year at the Hyatt (<3) before we move over to the Marriott and we want to go out with a bang and leave a lasting legacy at the Hyatt. You can expect this year to be the most monumental and epic DerbyCon we have ever put out.

The idea of DerbyCon started in a pizza shop in Louisville after a few of us thought how awesome it would be to create a conference in Louisville Kentucky. The 4th street live area was awesome and we had been to so many conferences that we felt we could make one where everyone was welcome. DerbyCon has and continues to be a conference put together and run by awesome people in the security industry and by its attendees. We believe that DerbyCon is a central location for everyone to come share their research – hang with friends – and meet new ones. We hope to see you this year!
