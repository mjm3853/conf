## Additional Details

We are a group of senior women product leaders working at a variety of Silicon Valley tech companies.

Our committee was formed to focus on creating a community for women in product management to learn from one another. As part of our mission, we're hosting a free conference exclusively for senior women product managers — the very first one in fact.

Our inaugural September event is designed to be a place to share lessons learned for succeeding as a leader in product — by women, for women. We have a fantastic speaker lineup, a great agenda for the day, terrific networking opportunities, and representation from multiple companies. As space is limited, our kick-off event will be by invitation only. Please indicate your interest by filling out the “sign up” form.
