## Additional Details

If you’re a tech company, you are likely publishing or consuming API’s already. API World is the first large-scale conference and expo with the goal of organizing this new API Economy. The API World 2017 Conference and Expo was created with the mission to be neutral and facilitate connections, knowledge, trust and business within the developer community of API providers and consumers. If you are a coder, a startup or an enterprise that consumes or provides multiple APIs this is your event.
