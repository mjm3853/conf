## Additional Details

Finding better ways for teams to work together is one of the biggest challenges facing every company and industry. That’s why we’re introducing Frontiers: a two–day conference by Slack that brings together leading thinkers, Slack customers, developers, and partners to explore how the nature of teamwork is changing. Be among the first to hear about Slack’s newest products, learn how Slack improves work and workflow, and hear from customers about the ways their organizations are evolving.
