## Additional Details

Technology’s role in commerce is growing larger every day. As store closings accelerate, traditional retailers are making investments in digital-native brands, and consumer packaged goods companies are considering selling direct to consumer. At the same time, e-commerce startups are opening their own brick-and-mortar stores and selling wholesale into others. In short — old and new have to learn from each other.
